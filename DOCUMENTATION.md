# Documentation Genulium Application

## Intro

**Gnulium** is a graphical UI for managing scripts and ideas, so you can add or get show of your OS in a second.

With all these features and scripts, this application is in **beta** release and needs some improvements.



## What's this about ?

So for this subject we need developers and programmers like anyone who can write code with `QT, QML (Qt quick), JavaScript, C or CPP and Python` and some other languages that is needed.

This documentation is created for open a clearly way to show you :

1. What is the project ?

2. How are these written ?

3. How do we make and export ?

4. What is the modules and submodules ?

5. What is needed for build and run or test a build ?

   ​

So let's get start



## Requirements

1. Installed **QT 5** and **QT 4**

2. Installed **Python**

3. Installed **Gcc** and **G++**

4. Installed **Qt-Creator**

5. **Git**

6. Editor (If not edit in qtCreator)

7. Time

8. Clever Mind

9. Work

10. Find Bug, Debug,Run,Test,Git,Commit,Push,Make a request

   ​



## Platform

For now we are working only on **Linux** OS, specially **Arch Linux** (KISS) the lovely one OS of all time. But maybe port it to another platform specially **macOS** because **UNIX** based OS.

So for now you need a Linux OS to join a contribution a project, we recommend **Ubuntu** but if you have courage and trust yourself try a Arch and start a developing.



## Where do we start ?

Aaaa this is a good question :)

1. At first **fork** the repo

2. **Clone** it to your pc or whatever else you have :

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/LinkarX/gnulium
   ```


3. **Go** to project's folder :

   ```sh
   $ ls -la
   $ cd gnulium
   ```

4. Now **Open** a folder in QtCreator or your Editor like : **VSCode**, **Atom** , so on but keep in mind for easy build and test a run you need QtCreator



## Structure ?

Now we arrive to the good part of this article.

In Gnulium folder, has 3 part and each of them has many files and folders again inside them.

1. appconf
2. modules
3. utils
4. main files

As you see there is some files in the Gnulium folder itself without any extra folder or folder :

These are **License**, **Readme Doc**, **Documentation**, **main.cpp**, **main.qml**, **qml.qrc**, **gnulium.pro**.

You can open them and see what's inside them.

After this there are 3 folder. But before we start to introduce those folder, what are these main files in Gnulium folder ?

So we skip some of them, these are important :

1. main.cpp
2. main.qml
3. qml.qrc
4. gnulium.pro

So
